## :hourglass_flowing_sand: Installation:
  To install this library, first be sure that you have node and npm installed. They are essencial for running the back and front end.
  The whole project was made based on Node.js, React and React Native. If you want to use this library, please download all the files and install according to the following steps.
  Steps
  1. In the backend folder, run the command `npm install` to install all the required packages listed on the file `package.json`. Note that some packages also have dependencies that are all being installed with this command and are required to the application.
  2. After installing the packages, run the command `npm start` to start the server. This will keep runing until you end the application (Ctrl + C) or close the window that is running. It will not run in the background, so you need to keep the window open.
  3. In the frontend folder, run the command `npm install`, to install the frontend dependencies and after that `npm start`. Your browser should open a new window/tab with the application runing.
  5. For running the mobile part, ***add mobile part***
  4. Enjoy the application!
  
## :cop: Remarks
  Please notice that this project was made during a week, for better understanding the concepts of the node.js, react and react native.
  This is not a deploy version of the application and may have some bugs. The whole purpose of this code is for learning and I do not have any guaranty if you want to deploy or use it commercially.
